Subject: Project Beta – Urgent: Data Source Alignment for Segmentation Accuracy
Hi Jose,
I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out regarding Project Beta’s customer segmentation model. During my analysis of the transactional data pipeline outputs (version beta_trans_v2.1), I noticed inconsistencies in the schema—specifically, missing customer_id fields in 12% of records and mismatched date formats (UTC vs. local timestamps). This is causing misalignment in our clustering algorithm’s accuracy.

I’ve attached a sample dataset highlighting the discrepancies. Could we schedule a 15-minute sync to confirm:

If the pipeline’s transformation logic intentionally drops these fields, or if this is a bug.

Whether timestamps can be standardized to UTC across all Beta datasets.

This is critical to meet the Q3 deadline. Let me know your availability!
Best regards,
