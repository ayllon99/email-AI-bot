Subject: Project Beta – Training Data Latency Blocking Model Iteration
Hi Jose,
The current training data refresh cycle for Project Beta (every 6 hours) is creating bottlenecks for model iteration. Our initial tests show that reducing latency to 1 hour could improve the F1-score by ~15% by capturing real-time purchase trends.

I understand the pipeline’s batch scheduling is managed by your team. Could we explore:

Switching from Airflow’s hourly batches to a Kafka stream for incremental updates.

Prioritizing this change in the sprint planning next week?

The business team is pushing for faster iterations, and your input here would be invaluable.
