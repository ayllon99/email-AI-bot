Subject: Project Gamma – Redshift Performance Tuning for Dashboard Load
Jose,
The Gamma dashboard’s backend queries are experiencing 8-10 second latency during peak traffic (2-4 PM daily), leading to user complaints. Current infrastructure:

Redshift cluster: 4 nodes (dc2.large)

No caching layer

Options to resolve this:

Scale vertically: Upgrade to ra3.4xlarge nodes for better compute.

Implement caching: Use Redis for frequent queries (e.g., daily active users).

Optimize queries: Materialize views for complex joins.

I’d like your take on the most cost-effective solution. Can we meet tomorrow to discuss?
Cheers,
