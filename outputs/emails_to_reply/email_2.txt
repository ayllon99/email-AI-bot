Subject: Project Alpha – Spark Config Review Request (Urgent)
Hi Jose,
I’m working on the Spark cluster setup for Project Alpha’s data pipeline and could use your expertise. Following the documentation, I configured the executors with 4GB memory and 2 cores each, but during testing, the job failed with OutOfMemoryError when processing the larger JSON files (~10GB).

I’ve attached my YAML configs and the error logs. Could you review whether:

The executor memory should be increased to 8GB.

We should enable dynamic allocation or adjust shuffle partitions.

I’d also appreciate guidance on best practices for handling nested JSON in this context. Are you free for a quick Teams call today?
Thanks so much,
Rahul Patel
