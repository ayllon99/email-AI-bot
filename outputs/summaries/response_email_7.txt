**Project Alpha – Scalability Risks in Current Pipeline Design**  

- **Introduction:**  
  - Request for an architecture review for Project Alpha.  

- **Key Concerns:**  
  - Current Kafka-to-Spark pipeline handles 50K events/sec.  
  - Post-Q4 scaling requires 500K events/sec.  
  - Kafka topic partitioning is static (12 partitions).  
  - Spark streaming uses FAIR scheduling, which may not scale.  

- **Recommendations:**  
  - Increase Kafka partitions to 60 + dynamic scaling.  
  - Switch to async checkpointing in Spark.  

- **Meeting Request:**  
  - Availability check for a review on Thursday.  
  - CTO has flagged this as high-priority.
