- **Subject:** Project Beta – Urgent: Data Source Alignment for Segmentation Accuracy

- Lila Chen has identified discrepancies in the transactional data pipeline (beta_trans_v2.1) for Project Beta's customer segmentation model, specifically:
  - **12% of records missing customer_id fields**
  - **Mismatched date formats (UTC vs. local timestamps)**

- These inconsistencies are affecting the clustering algorithm's accuracy.

- A sample dataset highlighting the discrepancies is attached for reference.

- Request for a 15-minute meeting to discuss:
  - Whether the pipeline's transformation logic intentionally drops customer_id fields or if it's a bug
  - Standardizing timestamps to UTC across all Beta datasets

- Urgent attention is required to meet the Q3 deadline; please confirm availability.
