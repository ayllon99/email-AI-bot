Okay, so I'm looking at this email from Marco Silva to Jose about Project Gamma. The main issue is that the dashboard's backend queries are slow, taking 8-10 seconds during peak times, which is causing user complaints. Marco has outlined the current setup: a Redshift cluster with 4 dc2.large nodes and no caching layer. He’s suggesting three options—scaling vertically by upgrading to ra3.4xlarge nodes, implementing Redis for caching frequent queries, or optimizing queries by materializing views for complex joins. He wants Jose's opinion on the most cost-effective solution and is asking for a meeting tomorrow to discuss.

I need to summarize this email into bullet points. First, I'll note the main issue with performance and latency. Then, I'll list the current infrastructure. Next, I'll outline the three proposed solutions. Finally, I'll include the request for a meeting. I should make sure each point is clear and concise, using professional language without any fluff. I'll avoid any markdown and just use plain bullet points as instructed.
