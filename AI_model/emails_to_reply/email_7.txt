Subject: Project Alpha – Scalability Risks in Current Pipeline Design**
Jose,
Let’s schedule a architecture review for Project Alpha. The current Kafka-to-Spark pipeline handles 50K events/sec, but post-Q4 scaling requires 500K events/sec. Key concerns:

Kafka topic partitioning is static (12 partitions).

Spark streaming uses FAIR scheduling, which may not scale.

Recommendations:

Increase Kafka partitions to 60 + dynamic scaling.

Switch to async checkpointing in Spark.

Are you available Thursday to walk through this? The CTO flagged this as high-priority.
