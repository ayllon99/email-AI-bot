Subject: Project Gamma – API Rate Limits Causing 429 Errors**
Hi Jose,
During stress testing of Gamma’s real-time API (built with FastAPI), we’re hitting Twitter API rate limits (900 requests/15min), resulting in 429 errors. Current mitigation:

Basic retry logic (3 attempts).

Proposals:

Exponential backoff: Implement with jitter.

Quota increase: Submit a request to Twitter’s dev team.

What’s your preference? The product team wants a resolution by EOD Friday.
Thanks,
Jamal Wright
