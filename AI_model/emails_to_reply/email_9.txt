Subject: Project Beta â€“ Timestamp Consistency for Feature Engineering
Hi Jose,
I'm engineering time-based features (e.g., "hours since last purchase") for Project Beta's model, but I'm unsure if the purchase_timestamp field in the pipeline output is UTC or local time. The raw data includes both (e.g., UTC-5 for US users).

Could you clarify:

Does the pipeline convert all timestamps to UTC before saving to Snowflake?

If not, is there a timezone metadata field I can join to standardize this?

This will impact model training starting next week. Thanks for your help!
