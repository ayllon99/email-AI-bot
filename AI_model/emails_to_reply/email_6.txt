Subject: Project Gamma – User Session Mismatch in Dashboard Data**
Hi Jose,
I’m validating the user session metrics for Project Gamma’s dashboard and noticed a 22% discrepancy between the dashboard’s counts and the raw Snowflake logs. For example, on 2023-10-05:

Snowflake: 1.2M sessions

Dashboard: 936K sessions

I suspect deduplication logic in the pipeline might be overly aggressive. Could you confirm if the session_id field in the cleaned data uses deterministic hashing? I’ve shared a sample query [here].

I’d appreciate your help—this is blocking my QA sign-off.
Best,
