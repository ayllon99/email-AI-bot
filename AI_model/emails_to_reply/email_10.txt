Subject: Project Alpha – Snowflake Write Permissions for CI/CD Pipeline**
Jose,
The CI/CD pipeline for Project Alpha (GitHub Actions → Terraform → AWS/EKS) is failing during the Snowflake write step due to insufficient permissions for the alpha_deploy service account.

Error:

INSERT permission denied on table raw_transactions  

Request:

Grant INSERT, UPDATE on raw_transactions to alpha_deploy.

Approve the Terraform PR [#2241] to automate this.

Can your team action this today? Deployment is blocked.
Cheers,
Arjun Kapoor
