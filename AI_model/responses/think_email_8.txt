Okay, so I need to summarize the email from Jamal about the Project Gamma issues. Let me read it carefully.

The subject is about API rate limits causing 429 errors. Jamal mentions they're doing stress testing and hitting Twitter's limits of 900 requests every 15 minutes. That's why they're getting these errors.

He says they have a basic retry logic with three attempts right now. Then he proposes two solutions: exponential backoff with jitter and requesting a quota increase from Twitter's dev team. He's asking Jose for his preference and mentions that the product team wants this resolved by end of day Friday.

I need to turn this into bullet points. First, I should note the issue with the 429 errors due to hitting rate limits. Then, the current mitigation of basic retry logic. Next, the two proposed solutions. Finally, the request for Jose's input and the deadline.

I should make sure each bullet is concise and clear, using professional language without any fluff. Also, avoid any closing remarks as per the instructions.
