Okay, so I need to summarize this email into bullet points. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

The subject is about Project Beta and the issue with training data latency affecting model iteration. The sender is Nia Okoro, a mid-level data scientist, and she's addressing Jose. 

In the email, Nia explains that the current 6-hour refresh cycle is causing bottlenecks. She mentions that reducing latency to 1 hour could improve the F1-score by about 15% by capturing real-time purchase trends. That's a significant improvement, so that's a key point.

She then acknowledges that Jose's team manages the pipeline's batch scheduling. She proposes two main suggestions: switching from Airflow's hourly batches to Kafka for incremental updates and prioritizing this change in the next sprint planning. 

She also mentions that the business team is pushing for faster iterations and values Jose's input. 

So, I need to break this down into clear bullet points. I should start with the main issue, then the proposed solutions, and finally the request for prioritization. I should keep the language professional and concise, avoiding any markdown as per the instructions.

I should make sure each bullet captures the essence without being too wordy. Let me structure it step by step to ensure I cover all the important points Nia made.
