- **Clarification Needed on Timestamp Consistency**:  
  - The purchase_timestamp field in the pipeline output needs to be confirmed as UTC or local time to ensure accurate feature engineering for Project Beta.  

- **Specific Questions for Jose**:  
  - Is the pipeline converting all timestamps to UTC before saving to Snowflake?  
  - If not, is there a timezone metadata field available to standardize this?  

- **Importance of Clarification**:  
  - This information is critical for model training, which is scheduled to begin next week.
