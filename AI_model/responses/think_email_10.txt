Okay, I need to summarize this email into bullet points. Let me read through it carefully.

The subject is about Project Alpha and Snowflake write permissions for the CI/CD pipeline. The sender is Arjun Kapoor, a Senior DevOps Engineer. He's writing to Jose.

The email says the CI/CD pipeline is failing because the alpha_deploy service account doesn't have enough permissions in Snowflake. Specifically, it's failing at the write step with a permission denied error on the raw_transactions table.

Arjun is requesting that INSERT and UPDATE permissions be granted to alpha_deploy on that table. He also mentions a Terraform PR, number 2241, which needs approval to automate this change. He's asking if Jose's team can handle this today because the deployment is blocked.

I need to capture all these points clearly and concisely. I should start with the main issue, then the error, the request, the PR approval, and the urgency.

Let me structure it step by step. First, the problem with the pipeline. Then the specific error. Next, the permissions needed. Then the Terraform PR and the request for action today.

I should make sure each bullet is clear and to the point, avoiding any unnecessary details. Also, maintain a professional tone as per the instructions.

I think that's all. Now, I'll put it together in bullet points.
