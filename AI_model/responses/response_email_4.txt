- The Gamma dashboard is experiencing 8-10 second latency during peak traffic (2-4 PM daily), leading to user complaints.
- Current Redshift infrastructure: 4 nodes (dc2.large) with no caching layer.
- Proposed solutions to resolve performance issues:
  - Scale vertically by upgrading to ra3.4xlarge nodes for improved compute power.
  - Implement a caching layer using Redis for frequently accessed queries (e.g., daily active users).
  - Optimize queries by materializing views for complex joins.
- Request for cost-effectiveness analysis and a meeting with Jose to discuss the options.
