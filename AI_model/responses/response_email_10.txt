- **Issue:** The CI/CD pipeline for Project Alpha is failing during the Snowflake write step due to insufficient permissions for the alpha_deploy service account.  
- **Error:** INSERT permission denied on table raw_transactions.  
- **Request:** Grant INSERT and UPDATE permissions on raw_transactions to the alpha_deploy service account.  
- **Action Required:** Approve the Terraform PR [#2241] to automate the permission changes.  
- **Urgency:** Please address this today as deployment is currently blocked.
